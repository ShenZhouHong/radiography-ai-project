\section{Project Code and Github Repository}\label{sec:appendix-repo}

All of the implementation details, model architecture, and data are made available in this project's Git repository (\href{https://github.com/ShenZhouHong/radiography-ai-project/}{Github}). Every code listing contains a link to the specific implementation, and different experiments also contain links to their corresponding Jupyter notebooks where the code was originally run. As a part of this project's commitment to reproducibility, all Jupyter notebooks are documented, and readers are encouraged to follow along and run the experiments for themselves. For further information, please see the repository \mintinline{python}{README.md}.
