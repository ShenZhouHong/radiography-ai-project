\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Georgios Mastorakis of Goldsmiths College, University of London, those support and encouragement were valuable aides throughout the journey of my thesis.
Special thanks to Dr. Renan Castillo of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, those guidance planted the very seeds of this project.
This endeavour would not have been possible without the work of my colleagues at the Major Extremity Trauma and Research Consortium (METRC), those research in the field of orthopaedic trauma yielded the very data that I build upon.
I am profoundly grateful for the countless patients those participation in \textsc{RetroDEFECT}, \textsc{Outlet}, \textsc{Pain}, and \textsc{Pacs}, advanced our understanding of trauma.

Finally, I would like to thank my mother, Wang Yanqi, and grandmother Liu Xia, who raised me to pursue my passions fearlessly. Without them, I would not be the person that I am today.
