# Standalone Figures and Graphs

This directory contains the LaTeX source code to generate standalone figures and graphs. These figures and graphs are mostly similar from `latex/figures/` and `latex/graphs/`, except they are created using the `standalone` documentclass for inclusion in external posters and presentations. Files are also modified from their original copies for ease of display and or embedding, such as larger scatter-plot dots in `hypersearch-regime-1.pdf`.

To build these files, run:

```bash
make
```
