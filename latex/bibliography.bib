    abstract     = {Background: The objective was to evaluate the newly developed Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures (RUST). Because there is no ``gold standard,'' it was hypothesized that the RUST score would provide substantial improvements compared with previous scores presented in the literature. Methods:  Forty-five sets of X-rays of tibial shaft fractures treated with intramedullary fixation were selected. Seven orthopedic reviewers independently scored bony union using RUST. Radiographs were reassessed at 9 weeks. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) measured agreement. Results:  Overall agreement was substantial (ICC, 0.86; 95{\%} CI, 0.79--0.91). There was improved reliability among traumatologists compared with others (ICC = 0.86, 0.81, and 0.83, respectively). Overall intraobserver reliability was also substantial (ICC, 0.88; 95{\%} CI, 0.80--0.96). Conclusions:  The RUST score exhibits substantial improvements in reliability from previously published scores and produces equally reproducible results among a variety of orthopedic specialties and experience levels. Because no ``gold standards'' currently exist against which RUST can be compared, this study provides only the initial step in the score's full validation for use in a clinical context.}

    abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a key opportunity for radiologists to improve quality of care and enhance the value of radiology in patient care and population health. The potential opportunity of AI to aid in triage and interpretation of conventional radiographs (X-ray images) is particularly significant, as radiographs are the most common imaging examinations performed in most radiology departments. Substantial progress has been made in the past few years in the development of AI algorithms for analysis of chest and musculoskeletal (MSK) radiographs, with deep learning now the dominant approach for image analysis. Large public and proprietary image data sets have been compiled and have aided the development of AI algorithms for analysis of radiographs, many of which demonstrate accuracy equivalent to radiologists for specific, focused tasks. This article describes (1) the basis for the development of AI solutions for radiograph analysis, (2) current AI solutions to aid in the triage and interpretation of chest radiographs and MSK radiographs, (3) opportunities for AI to aid in noninterpretive tasks related to radiographs, and (4) considerations for radiology practices selecting AI solutions for radiograph analysis and integrating them into existing IT systems. Although comprehensive AI solutions across modalities have yet to be developed, institutions can begin to select and integrate focused solutions which increase efficiency, increase quality and patient safety, and add value for their patients.}

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

This tool has high intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs); however, little evidence has evaluated the scores against the physical properties of bone healing. Closed, stabilized fractures were made in the femora of C3H/HeJ male mice (8–12 week-old) of two dietary groups: A control and a phosphate restricted diet group. Micro-computed tomography (µCT) and torsion testing were carried out at post-operative days (POD) 14, 21, 35, and 42 (n = 10–16) per group time-point. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographic views were constructed from the µCT scans and scored by five raters. The raters also indicated if the fracture were healed. ICCs were 0.71 (mRUST) and 0.63 (RUST). Both RUST scores were positively correlated with callus bone mineral density (BMD) (r = 0.85 and 0.80, p < 0.001) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (r = 0.86 and 0.80, p < 0.001). Both RUST scores positively correlated with callus strength (r = 0.35 and 0.26, p < 0.012) and rigidity (r = 0.50 and 0.39, p < 0.001). Radiographically healed calluses had a mRUST ≥13 and a RUST ≥10 and had excellent relationship to structural and biomechanical metrics. Effect of delayed healing due to phosphate dietary restrictions was found at later time points with all mechanical properties (p < 0.011), however no differences found in the RUST scores (p > 0.318). Clinical relevance of this study is both RUST scores showed high correlation to physical properties of healing and generally distinguished healed vs. non-healed fractures. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The growing literature now lists hundreds of optimization methods. In the absence of clear theoretical guidance and conclusive empirical evidence, the decision is often made based on anecdotes. In this work, we aim to replace these anecdotes, if not with a conclusive ranking, then at least with evidence-backed heuristics. To do so, we perform an extensive, standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular deep learning optimizers while giving a concise overview of the wide range of possible choices. Analyzing more than 50,000 individual runs, we contribute the following three points: (i) Optimizer performance varies greatly across tasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating multiple optimizers with default parameters works approximately as well as tuning the hyperparameters of a single, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern an optimization method clearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a significantly reduced subset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally lead to competitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender, with newer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it. Our open-sourced results are available as challenging and well-tuned baselines for more meaningful evaluations of novel optimization methods without requiring any further computational efforts.}

Elastic stable intramedullary nailing of long bone fractures in the skeletally immature has gained widespread popularity because of its clinical effectiveness and low risk of complications. Methods and methodology From Jan 2015 to August 2016, 35 patients including 37 limbs with diaphyseal fractures of the femur in the age group 5--15 years were managed by Titanium Elastic nailing and their clinico-radiological and functional outcome was assessed at 1 year post operatively as per the Flynn's criteria. RUST score was used as a guide for post-operative rehabilitation. Results 37 patients were managed by TENS nailing including 28 males and 9 females. The outcome in proximal, middle or distal fractures of the shaft were found to be similar and the difference was statistically insignificant. Similarly, the difference in the outcomes as per fracture patterns was also found to be statistically insignificant. Partial weight bearing was allowed after a score of 6 was achieved and full weight bearing after a score of 8. Conclusion As per the Flynn's criteria, 75{\%} of the patients (28 out of 37) were found to have an excellent outcome while 7 had a satisfactory outcome and two had a poor outcome. RUST score can be used as an effective guide for post op rehabilitation.}

This paper aims to develop an intelligent classification system that would be capable of detecting and classifying the bone fractures. The developed system comprises of two principal stages. In the first stage, the images of the fractures are processed using different image processing techniques in order to detect their location and shapes and the next stage is the classification phase, where a backpropagation neural network is trained and then tested on processed images. Experimentally, the system was tested on different bone fracture images and the results show high efficiency and a classification rate.}

Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field, propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically, in radiology practice, trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection, characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative, rather than qualitative, assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this Opinion article, we establish a general understanding of AI methods, particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology, with a general focus on applications in oncology, and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced.}

Recent evidence for image analysis using modern machine learning points to possible improvements in both the efficiency and the accuracy of chest X-ray interpretation. While promising, these machine learning algorithms have not provided comprehensive assessment of findings in an image and do not account for clinical history or other relevant clinical information. However, the rapid evolution in technology and evidence base for its use suggests that the next generation of comprehensive, well-tested machine learning algorithms will be a revolution akin to early advances in X-ray technology. Current use cases, strengths, limitations and applications of chest X-ray machine learning systems are discussed.}

Manual image analysis methods are labor-intense and they are susceptible to intra as well as inter-observer variability. Automated medical image analysis techniques can overcome these limitations. In this review, we investigated Transfer Learning (TL) architectures for automated medical image analysis. We discovered that TL has been applied to a wide range of medical imaging tasks, such as segmentation, object identification, disease categorization, severity grading, to name a few. We could establish that TL provides high quality decision support and requires less training data when compared to traditional deep learning methods. These advantageous properties arise from the fact that TL models have already been trained on large generic datasets and a task specific dataset is only used to customize the model. This eliminates the need to train the models from scratch. Our review shows that AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, and GoogleNet are the most widely used TL models for medical image analysis. We found that these models can understand medical images, and the customization refines the ability, making these TL models useful tools for medical image analysis.}

    abstract     = {Suspected fractures are among the most common reasons for patients to visit emergency departments (EDs), and X-ray imaging is the primary diagnostic tool used by clinicians to assess patients for fractures. Missing a fracture in a radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed treatment and poor recovery of function. Nevertheless, radiographs in emergency settings are often read out of necessity by emergency medicine clinicians who lack subspecialized expertise in orthopedics, and misdiagnosed fractures account for upward of four of every five reported diagnostic errors in certain EDs. In this work, we developed a deep neural network to detect and localize fractures in radiographs. We trained it to accurately emulate the expertise of 18 senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons by having them annotate 135,409 radiographs. We then ran a controlled experiment with emergency medicine clinicians to evaluate their ability to detect fractures in wrist radiographs with and without the assistance of the deep learning model. The average clinician’s sensitivity was 80.8\% (95\% CI, 76.7–84.1\%) unaided and 91.5\% (95\% CI, 89.3–92.9\%) aided, and specificity was 87.5\% (95 CI, 85.3–89.5\%) unaided and 93.9\% (95\% CI, 92.9–94.9\%) aided. The average clinician experienced a relative reduction in misinterpretation rate of 47.0\% (95\% CI, 37.4–53.9\%). The significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy that we observed in this study show that deep learning methods are a mechanism by which senior medical specialists can deliver their expertise to generalists on the front lines of medicine, thereby providing substantial improvements to patient care.}

For some injuries, amputation may result in better outcomes than limb salvage. This study compared the outcomes of patients who underwent limb salvage with those that would have been achieved had they undergone amputation. METHODS: This multicenter prospective observational study included patients 18 to 60 years of age in whom a Type-III pilon or IIIB or C ankle fracture, a Type-III talar or calcaneal fracture, or an open or closed blast/crush foot injury had been treated with limb salvage (n = 488) or amputation (n = 151) and followed for 18 months. The primary outcome was the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA). Causal effect estimates of the improvement that amputation would have provided if it had been performed instead of limb salvage were calculated for the SMFA score, physical performance, pain, participation in vigorous activities, and return to work. RESULTS: The patients who underwent limb salvage would have had small differences in most outcomes had they undergone amputation. The most notable difference was an improvement in the SMFA mobility score of 7 points (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 10.7). Improvements were largest for pilon/ankle fractures and complex injury patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Amputation should be considered a treatment option rather than a last resort for the most complex terminal lower-limb injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

Both models suffer from overfitting or poor generalization in many cases. Deep networks include more hyper-parameters than shallow ones that increase the overfitting probability. This paper states a systematic review of the overfit controlling methods and categorizes them into passive, active, and semi-active subsets. A passive method designs a neural network before training, while an active method adapts a neural network along with the training process. A semi-active method redesigns a neural network when the training performance is poor. This review includes the theoretical and experimental backgrounds of these methods, their strengths and weaknesses, and the emerging techniques for overfitting detection. The adaptation of model complexity to the data complexity is another point in this review. The relation between overfitting control, regularization, network compression, and network simplification is also stated. The paper ends with some concluding lessons from the literature.}

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Seven Level 1 trauma centers. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighty-two adults with severe tibia fractures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and receiver-operator curve) of an expert panel's assessment of likelihood ACS compared with fasciotomy as the reference diagnostic standard. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The interrater reliability of the expert panel as measured by the Krippendorff alpha. Expert panel consensus was determined using the percent of panelists in the majority group of low (expert panel likelihood of $\leq$0.3), uncertain (0.3-0.7), or high (>0.7) likelihood of ACS. RESULTS: Comparing fasciotomy (the diagnostic standard) and the expert panel's assessment as the diagnostic classification (test), the expert panel's determination of uncertain or high likelihood of ACS (threshold >0.3) had a sensitivity of 0.90 (0.70, 0.99), specificity of 0.95 (0.90, 0.98), PPV of 0.70 (0.50, 0.86), and NPV of 0.99 (0.95, 1.00). When a threshold of >0.7 was set as a positive diagnosis, the expert panel assessment had a sensitivity of 0.67 (0.43, 0.85), specificity of 0.98 (0.95, 1.00), PPV of 0.82 (0.57, 0.96), and NPV of 0.96 (0.91, 0.98). CONCLUSION: In our study, the retrospective assessment of an expert panel of the likelihood of ACS has good specificity and excellent NPV for fasciotomy, but only low-to-moderate sensitivity and PPV. The discordance between the expert panel-assessed likelihood of ACS and the decision to perform fasciotomy suggests that concern regarding potential diagnostic bias in studies of ACS is warranted.

POPULATION: The study included 132 patients with diaphyseal tibia bone defects >1 cm and $\geq$50\% cortical loss treated with intramedullary nail. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was number of secondary surgeries to promote healing (bone graft, revision fixation, or bone transport). Additional outcomes included occurrence of secondary surgeries (bone graft, infection, amputation, and flap failure) and proportion healed at one year. Results are compared by ``radiographic apparent bone gap'' of <2.5 or $\geq$2.5 cm. RESULTS: The estimated conditional probability of bone grafting within one year given graft-free at 90 days was 44\% and 47\% in the <2.5 cm and $\geq$2.5 cm groups, respectively. An estimated infection risk of 14\% was observed in both groups [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.33-2.92], estimated amputation risk was 9\% (<2.5 cm) and 4\% ($\geq$2.5 cm) (unadjusted HR 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.13-3.29), and estimated flap failure risk (among those with flaps) was 10\% and 13\%, respectively (unadjusted HR 1.71, 95\% CI: 0.24-12.25). There was no appreciable difference in the proportion healed at one year between defect sizes [adjusted HR: 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.63-1.82)]. CONCLUSIONS: Larger size bone defects were not associated with higher number of secondary procedures to promote healing or a lower overall one-year healing rate.

    abstract     = {In recent years, bone fracture detection and classification has been a widely discussed topic and many researchers have proposed different methods to tackle this problem. Despite this, a universal approach able to classify all the fractures in the human body has not yet been defined. We aim to analyze and evaluate a selection of papers, chosen according to their representative approach, where the authors applied different deep learning techniques to classify bone fractures, in order to select the strengths of each of them and try to delineate a generalized strategy. Each study is summarized and evaluated using a radar graph with six values: area under the curve (AUC), test accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, dataset size and labelling reliability. Plus, we defined the key points which should be taken into account when trying to accomplish this purpose and we compared each study with our baseline. In recent years, deep learning and, in particular, the convolution neural network (CNN), has achieved results comparable to those of humans in bone fracture classification. Adopting a correct generalization, we are reasonably sure that a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, correctly designed to assist doctors, would save a considerable amount of time and would limit the number of wrong diagnoses.}

Because there is no ``gold standard,'' it was hypothesized that the RUST score would provide substantial improvements compared with previous scores presented in the literature. Methods:  Forty-five sets of X-rays of tibial shaft fractures treated with intramedullary fixation were selected. Seven orthopedic reviewers independently scored bony union using RUST. Radiographs were reassessed at 9 weeks. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) measured agreement. Results:  Overall agreement was substantial (ICC, 0.86; 95{\%} CI, 0.79--0.91). There was improved reliability among traumatologists compared with others (ICC = 0.86, 0.81, and 0.83, respectively). Overall intraobserver reliability was also substantial (ICC, 0.88; 95{\%} CI, 0.80--0.96). Conclusions:  The RUST score exhibits substantial improvements in reliability from previously published scores and produces equally reproducible results among a variety of orthopedic specialties and experience levels. Because no ``gold standards'' currently exist against which RUST can be compared, this study provides only the initial step in the score's full validation for use in a clinical context.}

    abstract     = {Over the past few years, neural networks have exhibited remarkable results for various applications in machine learning and computer vision. Weight initialization is a significant step employed before training any neural network. The weights of a network are initialized and then adjusted repeatedly while training the network. This is done till the loss converges to a minimum value and an ideal weight matrix is obtained. Thus weight initialization directly drives the convergence of a network. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate weight initialization scheme becomes necessary for end-to-end training. An appropriate technique initializes the weights such that the training of the network is accelerated and the performance is improved. This paper discusses various advances in weight initialization for neural networks. The weight initialization techniques in the literature adopted for feed-forward neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and long short term memory network have been discussed in this paper. These techniques are classified as (1) initialization techniques without pre-training, which are further classified into random initialization and data-driven initialization, (2) initialization techniques with pre-training. The different weight initialization and weight optimization techniques which select optimal weights for non-iterative training mechanism have also been discussed. We provide a close overview of different initialization schemes in these categories. This paper concludes with discussions on existing schemes and the future scope for research.}

	abstract     = {Machine learning algorithms have been used widely in various applications and areas. To fit a machine learning model into different problems, its hyper-parameters must be tuned. Selecting the best hyper-parameter configuration for machine learning models has a direct impact on the model’s performance. It often requires deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms and appropriate hyper-parameter optimization techniques. Although several automatic optimization techniques exist, they have different strengths and drawbacks when applied to different types of problems. In this paper, optimizing the hyper-parameters of common machine learning models is studied. We introduce several state-of-the-art optimization techniques and discuss how to apply them to machine learning algorithms. Many available libraries and frameworks developed for hyper-parameter optimization problems are provided, and some open challenges of hyper-parameter optimization research are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of different optimization methods and provide practical examples of hyper-parameter optimization. This survey paper will help industrial users, data analysts, and researchers to better develop machine learning models by identifying the proper hyper-parameter configurations effectively.}
