% What have you access to already vs. what you will need to source, e.g.,
% What platforms/languages will you use?
% What equipment will you need? How will you source it?
% What physical materials, if any, will be involved?
% Highlight any costings
% What techniques will you use? (e.g. Machine Learning, Laser Cutting, Data Mining)
% What new skills do you need to acquire?
% How will you acquire these skills?
% Include links to online resources, and references to articles and/or books
% How will you draw on knowledge gained from current and past modules?
% What knowledge can you apply that you have acquired from experience outside of your degree

\section{Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries}
The AI models in this project will be developed in Python using the \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{Tensorflow} and \href{https://keras.io/}{Keras} frameworks. Additional pre-processing and numerical analysis will be done with \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/}{Pandas} and \href{https://numpy.org/}{NumPy}. 

\section{Inference and Compute Requirements}
This project will conduct inference through a remote Jupyter kernel provided by \href{https://www.paperspace.com/}{Paperspace Gradient}, a hosted machine learning platform. 

\noindent
Compute costs will be self-funded.
