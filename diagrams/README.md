# Draw.io/Diagrams.net Diagrams

This folder contains the XML source files for [Diagrams.net](https://www.drawio.com/) (formerly Draw.io) diagrams. Diagrams.net is an open source diagram maker that creates XML diagrams which can be exported in a variety of formats including vector formats such as SVG and PDF files.

These diagrams are used in various places for the project, including the final PDF report as well as the InDesign poster. 

In order to open the `.drawio` source files, they should be opened using the Diagrams.net web client. No registration is required, and the client is also available offline as an open source download. There are also VSCode/VSCodium plugins that support `.drawio` XML files natively.
